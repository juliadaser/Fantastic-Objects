An object I would like to make if I werenâ€™t limited by time, technology and money is a sensor that monitors the water levels in my body to detect whether I have drank enough water. According to the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, an an adequate daily fluid intake for women is at about 2.7 litres. In my daily routine I often forget to drink enough which can lead to headaches and fatigue. A device monitoring my water level would be super helpful as a reminder to drink more water. 

The object would work as follows: A device is constantly measuring the water level of my blood and monitoring it on an app that I can check on my phone. In case I have not drank enough water, the app sends me a reminder to drink water. As an extension to that functionality, it would also be interesting to see whether such a device could detect minerals like iron, zinc and magnesium, vitamins or even micro plastic levels in blood. 

Obviously I would need to develop a way to detect the above items in my blood without constantly taking blood samples. I think it would be very practical to wear the sensor as a wristband or possibly even a piece of jewellery like a finger-, or earring. The device should be light and portable so I could take it with me everywhere. Waterproofness and resistance to temperature differences should also be given, in addition to a way to easily charge the sensor.
